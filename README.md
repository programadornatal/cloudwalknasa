# Cloud Walk Nasa
Create app flutter with Nasa api (Picture of the day)

## Task

Build an app for one platform (Android or iOS) to show the pictures from NASA's "Astronomy Picture of the Day" website in a fashion manner.

One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. In fact, this website is one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies.

## Requirements

The app must contemplate the following requirements:

- Have two screens: a list of the images and a detail screen
- The images list must display the title, date and provide a search field in the top (find by title or date)
- The detail screen must have the image and the texts: date, title and explanation
- Must work offline (will be tested with airplane mode)
- Must support multiple resolutions and sizes

Regarding the screen with the list, it would be nice to have pull-to-refresh and pagination features.
